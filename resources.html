        <h3>Take the IBT</h3>
        <p>The IBT or Implicit Bias Test, shows how the same principal can be seen throughout many different topics. Due to key changes throughout the test, you may have bias that you do not even realize. Additionally, as the test goes on you may grow tired and have more errors like I did.</p>

        <h3>Intersectionality</h3>
        <p>Intersectionality is the idea that different parts of a person’s identity—such as race, gender, class, or sexuality—overlap and shape their experiences in unique ways. It explains how people can face multiple layers of discrimination or privilege at the same time, depending on how these identities interact. For example, someone may experience challenges not just because of their gender or their race, but because of the combination of both. This perspective helps us understand inequality more fully and encourages solutions that take into account the complexity of people’s lives </p>

        <h3>Implicit Bias</h3>
        <p>Implicit bias refers to the attitudes, stereotypes, and associations we hold unconsciously, outside our awareness, that influence how we perceive and act toward people (positively or negatively) based on characteristics like race, gender, or age. Unlike explicit bias, which we can observe and articulate, implicit bias operates beneath the surface and can subtly shape decisions, judgments, and behavior—even when we consciously believe we are fair. Because these biases are unintentional and automatic, they create a “blind spot” that can undermine equity: for example, in hiring, a recruiter might unconsciously favor candidates who went to the same university or “look like them,” reducing opportunities for people from underrepresented backgrounds. </p>
