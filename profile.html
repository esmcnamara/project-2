      <h2>Joy Buolamwini</h2>

      <p> Joy Buolamwini is a Ghanaian-American computer scientist, researcher, and activist best known as the founder of the Algorithmic Justice League (AJL). Born in 1989 in Edmonton, Canada, and raised in Mississippi, she grew up at the intersection of art and science, influenced by her parents’ academic and creative backgrounds. Buolamwini studied computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology and later pursued graduate work at Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar. She then continued at the MIT Media Lab, where her work on artificial intelligence and computer vision would spark international attention.
Her journey into AI bias research began with a personal experience: commercial facial recognition systems often failed to detect her darker-skinned face until she put on a white mask. This led her to investigate algorithmic bias systematically. Her groundbreaking project, Gender Shades, showed that popular facial recognition services from major tech companies had much higher error rates for women and people with darker skin tones. By publishing this research and bringing it to public view, Buolamwini forced companies like Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon to reconsider how they tested and sold their facial recognition products.
In 2016, Buolamwini founded the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that combines research, advocacy, and art to highlight the social implications of artificial intelligence. AJL has released audits, testified before government bodies, and created public campaigns like Coded Bias, a documentary that tells the story of algorithmic harms through her work. By blending poetry, data, and activism, she challenges the assumption that algorithms are neutral, showing instead how they often reflect existing inequalities in society.
Although Buolamwini is not building shopping platforms or scaling global marketplaces like some tech entrepreneurs, her impact is equally global in a different way. Her work represents a push for equity and representation in computing, ensuring that technologies used worldwide treat all groups fairly. She continues to be a leading voice in AI ethics and policy, urging governments, companies, and engineers to recognize the human stakes behind technical decisions. Her path reminds newcomers that technology is never separate from society and that questioning assumptions is just as important as writing code.

      <h2>Sam Udotong</h2>

      <p> 
        Sam Udotong is a Nigerian-American engineer, entrepreneur, and artificial intelligence innovator best known as the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Fireflies.ai, a company that uses AI to automate meeting notes and voice intelligence for teams. Born and raised in the United States to Nigerian parents, Udotong grew up with a deep curiosity about how technology could amplify human potential. He studied Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science at MIT, where he combined technical rigor with a growing passion for using AI to solve real-world communication problems. His early projects reflected a fascination with how data, speech, and human collaboration intersect — interests that would later form the foundation of his startup.
After graduating, Udotong co-founded Fireflies.ai in 2016 alongside Krish Ramineni. The platform uses advanced speech recognition and natural language processing to automatically record, transcribe, and summarize conversations across popular video conferencing tools such as Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams. Under his technical leadership, Fireflies has grown from a small MIT project into a globally recognized company used by millions of professionals. Its core mission — freeing people from repetitive note-taking and letting them focus on meaningful discussion — reflects Udotong’s broader vision of AI as a collaborative partner rather than a replacement for human intelligence.
Udotong’s contributions have earned him recognition from Forbes, which named him to its 30 Under 30 list in Enterprise Technology, celebrating his innovative approach to bringing AI into everyday workflows. Beyond Fireflies, he has become an emerging voice in discussions about responsible innovation, workplace automation, and the evolving relationship between humans and machines. As a young Black founder in the tech world, he also represents a new generation of entrepreneurs who blend technical mastery with a commitment to inclusivity and impact.
